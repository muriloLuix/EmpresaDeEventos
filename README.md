# Hello EveryBody!

In this project I'm developing, it's a responsive landing page for print, mobile, and with functional forms for a client to get in touch to acquire event organization services. Here, individuals can learn about the company, services, contact, and other important information. Its usage is free for anyone interested, just leave the credits in your repository and use a Fork to help me.
